## Process 

I make use of the HTML audio element. An audio element represent a sound or audio stream. Also, created an empty div with an ID of buttons which I create a button element inside the div with a class of btn in JavaScript. 

Created an array that hold the IDs of each audio file and loop the variable, create an element inside the loop and appendChild the button to the buttons div, add a click event listener to the btn in order to play the sound or audio on click by using the > play() property

Also, created another function that stop the current playing audio when one click on another button, so it doesn't play all the audio clicked together once and mess it all up

- [] I want to continue learning and working with the forEach loop
- [] Also, re-design the whole website and turn it to a music website where you can download, stream
